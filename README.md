# SF-Movies
Movies filmed in San Francisco

## Tech stack
Node.js, Express, TypeScript - 1.5 years
MongoDB - 1 year

## How I'd complete the submission if I had more time
I'd write an extensive documentation for the API and also add more get queries

## What I'd add to extend the project, given more time
I'd clean and arrange every recurring movie name under one instance and then add the various locations as arrays and the various coordinates as objects or maps 

## Difficulties I faced
Inserting the data into my MongoDB database, since I had to structure it to fit my defined schema for the movies.
